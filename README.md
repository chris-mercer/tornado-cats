**Tornado Cats** is a book for learning zero-knowledge applications and decentralized mixing by creating a simple mixer protocol based on Tornado Cash. This is still under construction and is currently available only in Japanese.

This book is available live at https://minaminao.github.io/tornado-cats/.
